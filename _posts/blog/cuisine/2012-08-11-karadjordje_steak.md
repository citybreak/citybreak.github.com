Karadjordje's steak (Serbian: Karađorđeva šnicla - Карађорђева шницла) is a Serbian breaded cutlet dish named after the Serbian Prince Karadjordje. It is a rolled veal or pork steak, stuffed with kajmak, breaded and baked (or fried). It is served with roasted potatoes and tartar sauce.
The steak is sometimes called jokingly "maidens' dream" (девојачки сан/devojački san),[1] because of its phallic shape.[1][2]
The steak is a modern invention, created by chef Mića Stojanović in 1959[2] who, when needed to prepare Chicken Kiev for a distinguished visitor from Russia, was faced with lack of poultry. He used veal instead of chicken.[2] However, not fully satisfied with the result, he poured tartar sauce over it, and decorated it with a slice of lemon and pieces of tomato, which at the end resembled Karadjordje's star decoration, and thus was the steak named
